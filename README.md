# How to install TAMSAT-ALERT v1.0

TAMSAT-ALERT is comprised of a few Python scripts. To install TAMSAT-ALERT, download the code in https://github.com/tamsat-alert/v1-0 from GitHub into a location where you have read and write permissions.  
TAMSAT-ALERT requires a working installation of Python 2.7 with the following modules installed: numpy, datetime, os, matplotlib, scipy, statsmodels, seaborn, copy, glob, sys, warnings, shutil, math, string. 
The instructions below assume that python can be called on a command line - i.e. that the user is using a unix or linux system/emulator. Alternatively, the scripts can be called from within a Python IDE for example by substituting execfile('prepare_driving_wrapper.py') rather than python prepare_driving_wrapper.py.

For further details about running TAMSAT-ALERT-v1 please see the TAMSAT-ALERT_user_user_manual.txt file included in https://github.com/tamsat-alert/v1-0/.
